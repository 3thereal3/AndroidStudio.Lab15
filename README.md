# Flutter Function Calculator App

This is a simple Flutter application that calculates the result of the mathematical function \( y = 8x^2 - 9x \) and displays it in real-time.

## Features

- Calculate the function \( y = 8x^2 - 9x \) dynamically.
- Display the calculated result based on an incrementing counter.
- FloatingActionButton with a camera icon (`Icons.camera_alt_outlined`) to increment the counter.
- Customized app title showing group and developer name.
- Unit and widget tests to verify logic and UI.
